# HelpDesk Demo

## Overview

Welcome to the HelpDesk Demo repository! This project is a showcase of my skills in web development, highlighting the use of Next.js, Prisma, Next-auth, NextUI, Axios, Tailwind, and Chart.js. It represents a private work I did a few years back, and I've created this live version to provide you with an interactive demonstration of the application.

## The stack

**Next.js:** A React framework that enables server-side rendering and other advanced features for building modern web applications.\
**Prisma:** A modern database toolkit for Node.js and TypeScript that simplifies database access with a type-safe and auto-generated query builder.\
**Next-auth:** An authentication library for Next.js applications, providing a secure and flexible way to handle user authentication.\
**NextUI:** A React component library for building beautiful and responsive user interfaces.\
**Axios:** A promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js, making it easy to send asynchronous HTTP requests.\
**Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development by providing a set of pre-built classes for common styling tasks.\
**Chart.js:** A simple yet flexible JavaScript charting library for designers and developers to create interactive and visually appealing charts.
